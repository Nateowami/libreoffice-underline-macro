h1. LibreOffice underline macro

The purpose of this macro is to apply formatting based on plain text. Specifically, text surrounded with @%u@ and @u%@ will be underlined.

For example, if this is found in the document:

bq. A &#37;uwordu&#37; should be underlined.

The resulting formatting will be:

bq. A +word+ should be underlined.

The use case for this is that formatting information may need to be passed through a system that does not support formatting before being added to the document. By using @%u@ and @u%@ tags the formatting information can be preserved no matter the system handeling the data.
